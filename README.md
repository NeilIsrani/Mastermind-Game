# Mastermind-Game
Mastermind (Links to an external site.) is a coding-breaking board game for two players. The “secret code” is a set of 4 colors chosen out of a possible 6 colors, where the player needs to guess which colors are in which positions in the 4-color secret code. After each guess, the player learns how many colors in their guess are in the right position, and how many had a color that’s in the code but the color is in the wrong position. Scoring pegs of different colors were used to show them how many correct guesses and how many correct positions they had gotten with their guess. Red pegs meant a correct color but out of position, black pegs meant a correct color in the correct position.

This mastermind game uses Turtle to for it’s UI interface. The players must
guess a sequence of 4 colors set up at the start of each round.  A complete selection
(4 color clicks and a click on the check) is passed as a list to a scorer, which
Then passes a score to the pointers for display and to the leaderboard.
