This mastermind game uses Turtle to first draw out the grids, pointers,
color selectors, leaderboard, and buttons for checking color selection,
erasing color selections (cross) and exiting game. The player must
guess a sequence of 4 colors set up at the start of each round. Despite
the game running the functions in the Initializer class multiple times it 
keeps track of the current row and selection through global lists that are 
appended and popped from according to their usage. A complete selection
(4 color clicks and a click on the check) is passed as a list to a scorer, which
Then passes a score to the pointers for display and to the leaderboard.
Button clicks are registered in largely two sections: selections and buttons, that drive the 
game accordingly. The game outputs a leaderboard txt file (to keep 
continuity across runs of the program) and an error logging file.

Some things to note while playing it that a complete selection of 4 colors 
must be made before using the erasing cross button. Also, colors should 
be chosen slowly (wait the one second for them to appear before picking
the next) or else it will overload the game. Also, the exit function can 
only be accessed if the game is started (that is, it has received at least
one color selection). The game is also sensitive to clicks outside the buttons
and selectors; clicks outside these zones will make the gaming experience 
less smooth.
